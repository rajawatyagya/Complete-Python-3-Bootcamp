# # Collections Module
# 
# The collections module is a built-in module that implements specialized container data types providing alternatives to Pythonâ€™s general purpose built-in containers. We've already gone over the basics: dict, list, set, and tuple.
# 
# Now we'll learn about the alternatives that the collections module provides.
# 
# ## Counter
# 
# *Counter* is a *dict* subclass which helps count hashable objects. Inside of it elements are stored as dictionary keys and the counts of the objects are stored as the value.
# 
# Let's see how it can be used:

# In[1]:


from collections import Counter


# **Counter() with lists**

# In[2]:


lst = [1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,1,2,1,12,3,2,32,1,21,1,223,1]

Counter(lst)


# **Counter with strings**

# In[3]:


Counter('aabsbsbsbhshhbbsbs')


# **Counter with words in a sentence**

# In[4]:


s = 'How many times does each word show up in this sentence word times each each word'

words = s.split()

Counter(words)


# In[5]:


# Methods with Counter()
c = Counter(words)

c.most_common(2)


# ## Common patterns when using the Counter() object

#     sum(c.values())                 # total of all counts
#     c.clear()                       # reset all counts
#     list(c)                         # list unique elements
#     set(c)                          # convert to a set
#     dict(c)                         # convert to a regular dictionary
#     c.items()                       # convert to a list of (elem, cnt) pairs
#     Counter(dict(list_of_pairs))    # convert from a list of (elem, cnt) pairs
#     c.most_common()[:-n-1:-1]       # n least common elements
#     c += Counter()                  # remove zero and negative counts

# ## defaultdict
# 
# defaultdict is a dictionary-like object which provides all methods provided by a dictionary but takes a first argument (default_factory) as a default data type for the dictionary. Using defaultdict is faster than doing the same using dict.set_default method.
# 
# **A defaultdict will never raise a KeyError. Any key that does not exist gets the value returned by the default factory.**

# In[6]:


from collections import defaultdict


# In[7]:


d = {}


# In[8]:


d['one'] 


# In[9]:


d  = defaultdict(object)


# In[10]:


d['one'] 


# In[11]:


for item in d:
    print(item)


# Can also initialize with default values:

# In[12]:


d = defaultdict(lambda: 0)


# In[13]:


d['one']


# ## OrderedDict
# An OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order in which its contents are added.
# 
# For example a normal dictionary:

# In[14]:


print('Normal dictionary:')

d = {}

d['a'] = 'A'
d['b'] = 'B'
d['c'] = 'C'
d['d'] = 'D'
d['e'] = 'E'

for k, v in d.items():
    print(k, v)


# An Ordered Dictionary:

# In[15]:


from collections import OrderedDict

print('OrderedDict:')

d = OrderedDict()

d['a'] = 'A'
d['b'] = 'B'
d['c'] = 'C'
d['d'] = 'D'
d['e'] = 'E'

for k, v in d.items():
    print(k, v)


# ## Equality with an Ordered Dictionary
# A regular dict looks at its contents when testing for equality. An OrderedDict also considers the order the items were added.
# 
# A normal Dictionary:

# In[16]:


print('Dictionaries are equal?')

d1 = {}
d1['a'] = 'A'
d1['b'] = 'B'

d2 = {}
d2['b'] = 'B'
d2['a'] = 'A'

print(d1==d2)


# An Ordered Dictionary:

# In[17]:


print('Dictionaries are equal?')

d1 = OrderedDict()
d1['a'] = 'A'
d1['b'] = 'B'


d2 = OrderedDict()

d2['b'] = 'B'
d2['a'] = 'A'

print(d1==d2)


# # namedtuple
# The standard tuple uses numerical indexes to access its members, for example:

# In[18]:


t = (12,13,14)


# In[19]:


t[0]


# For simple use cases, this is usually enough. On the other hand, remembering which index should be used for each value can lead to errors, especially if the tuple has a lot of fields and is constructed far from where it is used. A namedtuple assigns names, as well as the numerical index, to each member. 
# 
# Each kind of namedtuple is represented by its own class, created by using the namedtuple() factory function. The arguments are the name of the new class and a string containing the names of the elements.
# 
# You can basically think of namedtuples as a very quick way of creating a new object/class type with some attribute fields.
# For example:

# In[20]:


from collections import namedtuple


# In[21]:


Dog = namedtuple('Dog','age breed name')

sam = Dog(age=2,breed='Lab',name='Sammy')

frank = Dog(age=2,breed='Shepard',name="Frankie")


# We construct the namedtuple by first passing the object type name (Dog) and then passing a string with the variety of fields as a string with spaces between the field names. We can then call on the various attributes:

# In[22]:


sam


# In[23]:


sam.age


# In[24]:


sam.breed


# In[25]:


sam[0]


# ## Conclusion
# 
# Hopefully you now see how incredibly useful the collections module is in Python and it should be your go-to module for a variety of common tasks!
