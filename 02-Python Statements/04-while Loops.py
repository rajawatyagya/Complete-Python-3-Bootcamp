# # while Loops
# 
# The <code>while</code> statement in Python is one of most general ways to perform iteration. A <code>while</code> statement will repeatedly execute a single statement or group of statements as long as the condition is true. The reason it is called a 'loop' is because the code statements are looped through over and over again until the condition is no longer met.
# 
# The general format of a while loop is:
# 
#     while test:
#         code statements
#     else:
#         final code statements
# 
# Let’s look at a few simple <code>while</code> loops in action. 

# In[1]:


x = 0

while x < 10:
    print('x is currently: ',x)
    print(' x is still less than 10, adding 1 to x')
    x+=1


# Notice how many times the print statements occurred and how the <code>while</code> loop kept going until the True condition was met, which occurred once x==10. It's important to note that once this occurred the code stopped. Let's see how we could add an <code>else</code> statement:

# In[2]:


x = 0

while x < 10:
    print('x is currently: ',x)
    print(' x is still less than 10, adding 1 to x')
    x+=1
    
else:
    print('All Done!')


# # break, continue, pass
# 
# We can use <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>, and <code>pass</code> statements in our loops to add additional functionality for various cases. The three statements are defined by:
# 
#     break: Breaks out of the current closest enclosing loop.
#     continue: Goes to the top of the closest enclosing loop.
#     pass: Does nothing at all.
#     
#     
# Thinking about <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements, the general format of the <code>while</code> loop looks like this:
# 
#     while test: 
#         code statement
#         if test: 
#             break
#         if test: 
#             continue 
#     else:
# 
# <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements can appear anywhere inside the loop’s body, but we will usually put them further nested in conjunction with an <code>if</code> statement to perform an action based on some condition.
# 
# Let's go ahead and look at some examples!

# In[3]:


x = 0

while x < 10:
    print('x is currently: ',x)
    print(' x is still less than 10, adding 1 to x')
    x+=1
    if x==3:
        print('x==3')
    else:
        print('continuing...')
        continue


# Note how we have a printed statement when x==3, and a continue being printed out as we continue through the outer while loop. Let's put in a break once x ==3 and see if the result makes sense:

# In[4]:


x = 0

while x < 10:
    print('x is currently: ',x)
    print(' x is still less than 10, adding 1 to x')
    x+=1
    if x==3:
        print('Breaking because x==3')
        break
    else:
        print('continuing...')
        continue


# Note how the other <code>else</code> statement wasn't reached and continuing was never printed!
# 
# After these brief but simple examples, you should feel comfortable using <code>while</code> statements in your code.
# 
# **A word of caution however! It is possible to create an infinitely running loop with <code>while</code> statements. For example:**

# In[ ]:


# DO NOT RUN THIS CODE!!!! 
while True:
    print("I'm stuck in an infinite loop!")
